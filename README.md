# Local AI Voice Home Assistant

A voice assistant for fully local home automation and AI interactions. Places locally-run AI in the middle of the home automation system. Wyoming Protocol is used for voice processing pipelines and Model Context Protocol (MCP) is implemented for AI tool and service connections.

Built with modules from Rhasspy (https://github.com/rhasspy)


**Note: This project is for me to learn how LLM workflows, agents and tools all work together. It will be constantly changing as I experiment with it, hopefully some other people find it also interesting and maybe even one day usable!**

## Overview

This voice assistant provides hands-free control of your smart home devices, answers questions, and engages in natural conversations. It uses local AI models for privacy and includes home automation and life admin capabilities.

### Key Features

- **Voice Recognition**: Real-time speech-to-text using Whisper
- **Wake Word Detection**: Custom wake word detection using OpenWakeWord
- **Quick Intent Capture**: Optional keyword matching to quickly capture intents before activating AI
- **AI Chat**: Natural language conversations using local LLMs
- **Home Automation**: Control lights, thermostats, music, and more
- **Life Admin**: Provide household information and check calender, set timers etc.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Natural voice responses using Piper TTS
- **Privacy-First**: Designed to work with small LLM's running on home pc or laptop, no data sent to cloud.
- **AI Centric**: AI is main focus of the home assistant, not an addon.
- **Split AI for task focus**: Smaller, specifically prompted AI model for tool and intent identification. Larger AI model for conversation.

## Version

**Current Version**: 0.1.0

## Architecture

The application is built to run on a single pc. Mini PC's with 12GB RAM should be able run the whole setup. For speedier response times a central mid-range GPU server can be setup with AudioRelay (https://audiorelay.net) being used to run audio interfaces through old Android phones setup around the house. An AudioRelay setup script is included in the repo for reference.

## Setup Instructions

   #### Docker Setup
   
   **Local Setup** (everything on one computer):
   ```bash
   ./setup-local.sh
   ```
   
### Configuration & Setup

1. **Audio Configuration**: Edit `config.py` to match your audio hardware
2. **Service URLs**: Update service URIs in `config.py` if using different ports or offloading LLM's and speech modules
3. **Smart Home and Music**: Configure information maps and device credentials in `tools/` modules, see json.example files. Remove any tools not needed. Add `device_id` key to `spotify_creds.json` with the target device name for music playback.
4. **Create Vector DB**: Update family, location and intent info jsons in `utils/`. Run `createdb.py` to build a vector db for retrieval augmented generation.
5. **Download Voice**: Choose a voice from (https://huggingface.co/rhasspy/piper-voices) and load it into `piper_data/voice/`. Set correct voice in docker compose file.

## Usage Instructions

### Starting the Assistant

```bash
cd controller
python launch.py
```

The launcher will:
1. Check dependencies and services
2. Set up logging and error handling
3. Start the voice assistant with proper configuration
